Its magnetism is so powerful it dries up moisture in its vicinity, and is potentially fatal to devices like TVs. As a result, large cities have sirens to warn their citizens of Magneton appearances, and trainers are warned to keep Magneton inside their Poké Balls. When it evolves, the Magnemite's brains link up, though they do not become three times smarter. When rain clouds form, they like to gather in high spots where lightning could strike. Sandy Shocks appears to be an ancient relative of it.

Farfetch'd,Normal / Flying,No evolution[nb 6],"It carries around a green onion stalk like a sword. It apparently knows where the best ones are and will fight other Farfetch'd over them. In emergencies, it will eat them, and then run off to find a new one. Farfetch'd were so rare at one point that people bred them to regrow the population. Since it cannot live without it, it will defend its stalk with its life. It has a Fighting-type Galarian form.

Dodrio,Normal / Flying,Doduo (#0084),"The head with the thickest neck is deemed the leader, and has control over the body. The three heads express joy, sorrow, and anger as they plan strategies together. If they cannot agree on something to do or overthink their plans, they will be unable to move.

Muk,Poison,Grimer (#0088),"It is based on the dorotabō, a one-eyed, three-fingered yōkai that rises from the mud of neglected, overgrown rice fields. Muk is covered in a toxic filthy sludge so vile that any land it walks through becomes inhospitable for up to three years. A drop of its body fluid can turn a pool rancid or leave a person bedridden for days. Its nose has devolved, so it cannot smell anything. It feeds on anything repugnant and filthy, like sewer water. Its numbers have started declining since people have begun cleaning up towns, and because some people think it may go extinct, sludge pools are being built to prevent this. Like Grimer, it has a Poison/Dark-type Alolan form.

Haunter,Ghost / Poison,Gastly (#0092),"Because of its ability to slip through walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. It saps its victims' life by licking them with its cold, gaseous tongue. Those licked by it grow weaker with each passing day, shaking uncontrollably until they die. If one trips and falls for no apparent reason or hear a sound when no one is around, it may be a Haunter. Because it fears the light and revels in the dark, it may be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay brightly lit at night. On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse.
",28,90,0
Gengar,Ghost / Poison,Haunter (#0093),"Gengar seeps into the shadows of people and Pokémon to scare them for fun or eat their life force. A sudden chill of 10 °F or cooler may be a Gengar trying to curse someone. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey. It likes to attack people in mountains. Sometimes, Gengar will pose as people's shadows. It apparently wishes for a traveling companion.

Onix,Rock / Ground,N/A,"It usually lives underground. As it grows, the stone portions of its body harden to become similar to a diamond, but colored black. Despite its large body being over 26 feet long, it can squirm its way through the ground at 50 mph. As it digs through the ground, it eats hard objects, which makes its body more solid. Diglett may use the tunnels it burrows as homes. Onix has a magnet in its brain, which acts as a compass so that it does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother. It evolves into Steelix when traded while holding a Metal Coat.[8][60][61][62] While its Defense and Speed are high, Onix' other values are deceptively low, making it a relatively weak Rock-type choice compared to Golem and Rhydon.[63]

Jynx,Ice / Psychic,Smoochum (#0238),"Jynx has spawned controversy due to aspects of its design being similar to blackface, leading Game Freak to change the color of its skin from black to purple.[79][80][81][82][83] When Pokémon Yellow was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, the in-game sprite of Jynx was edited to reflect this change.[83] Jynx's appearance is a purple humanoid with blond hair and a dress.

Its body temperature is 2,200 °F. It dislikes cold places, so it blows flames to make the environment suitable for itself. Its appearance is often obscured by the flames that cover it.

Pinsir,Bug,N/A,"It was originally supposed to have an evolution called ""Plux"" in generation II.

Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns, and will not be released until they are torn in half. If it cannot be torn in half, it tosses it around. In addition to hunting prey, it also tends to enjoy tree sap. Pinsir live in temperate forests or jungles, and burrow their way underground or inside trees to avoid the cold. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt, yet gets along with Heracross. In other regions, however, it competes with Heracross for food. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers, which also determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how thick it looks. It gained a Mega Evolution in generation VI.

If there are no opponents, it will charge into thick trees, knocking them down. Historically, people have ridden Tauros for ages, a practice said to have started in Alola. Tauros in Alola actually have a calm side, most likely due to the climate. Tauros in Galar, however, are more volatile and will not let people ride them. It has three Paldean forms.

Magikarp,Water,N/A,"Magikarp is mostly useless in the games, until it evolves into Gyarados. Magikarp is based on the common carp.[74] At level 15, Magikarp learns Tackle. Until then, it only knows Splash and cannot be taught any other moves. In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the descendants that exist today. Despite its weakness, it is actually a hardy and fertile Pokémon that can survive in any body of water. Its swimming muscles are weak, so it gets easily washed away by currents, so places where water pools like seas, lakes, rivers, and shallow puddles will have many Magikarp stuck in them. It may jump on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump. In rare occasions, a Magikarp living for many years can leap up a mountain.

Gyarados,Water / Flying,Magikarp (#0129),"When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation, said to be the cause of its violent nature.

Ditto,Normal,No evolution,"Appearing as an amorphous blob, Ditto is capable of transforming into an exact copy of anything it sees by altering its genetic code. However, this transformation is often imperfect.[95] The specific imperfections vary from Ditto to Ditto. It does not get along with others of the same species, as they will both fruitlessly try to transform into each other. Ditto rose in popularity with Gold and Silver, where it was able to ""breed"" with any other Pokémon that is able to breed, becoming vital for the franchise's competitive scene. It cannot breed with itself, though.[96] Due to its similarities to Mew, a longtime rumor arose that it was a failed clone. However, this fan theory has been denied by Game Freak.[97]

Vaporeon,Water,Eevee (#0133),"Its genes and DNA are nearly identical to water, so it can melt away into it to hide from foes or prey. If its fins begin to mutate, it means rain is coming in a couple of hours. It has the ability to freely control water. It evolves from Eevee using a Water Stone.[105] Vaporeon became the ambassador for Water Day in Japan in 2023.[106] A popular internet copypasta, stating that Vaporeon was the most sexually compatible with humans out of all Pokémon species, became a meme among the Pokémon community. Originally posted on 4chan in 2018, its spread was attributed to its sudden, overly detailed, unprompted nature.

Jolteon,Electric,Eevee (#0133),"It accumulates negative ions in the air to dish out 10,000 volt discharges. It is a moody Pokémon, easily becoming sad or angry, and its spiky fur can be launched to pierce enemies when it bristles.

In 2014, during the Twitch Plays Pokemon experiment, an Eevee was the source of much debate due to the players wanting to evolve it into a Vaporeon or a Jolteon, but they accidentally used a Fire Stone to evolve it into a Flareon. This incident led to the Flareon being named to the “False Prophet” by the Twitch community.[108][109][110][111][112][113]

Porygon,Normal,N/A,"Porygon has become notorious for being featured in an episode of the anime that caused widespread epileptic seizures in Japanese viewers.[114] Created in 1995, it is made entirely of programming code. It can enter cyberspace at will. People theorized it could go into outer space, though no Porygon has managed to achieve this so far. It has no heartbeat and does not need to eat, though it can eat if food is given. Because of this, people are eager to test it in any environment. Porygon is copy-protected so it cannot be duplicated. It was made with the best technology of 1995, so it has become outdated compared to Pokémon like Genesect and Type: Null. It is still useful in cyberspace, as it goes around making sure no suspicious data exists.
